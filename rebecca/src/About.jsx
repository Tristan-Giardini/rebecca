    Rebecca Storm was born and raised on Vancouver Island, BC and now lives and works in Montreal, QC, where her creative practice shifted from photography to painting in 2020 after experiencing a TBI. Her work aims to explore the semiotics of passing time, and the somatic experience of conscious and subconscious memory. Elements of fantasy emerge occasionally, suggesting the psycheâ€™s vulnerability to muddiness, and as a way of offering optical euphemism and allegory. Her paintings implement visual ciphers, which attempt to decode how cycles of trauma, addiction, spirituality, and power impact a sense of identity and autonomy. She is interested in contemplating how we are often unconsciously at the mercy of these forces, and how they ambiently flavor the nature of our lived experience, as well as our capacity for remembering, both universally and subjectively. Occasionally referencing a collective visual vernacular, in addition to experiences that are deeply personal, her work is as much about reckoning with the oppression of time as it is interested in cultivating a reverence for impermanence.
